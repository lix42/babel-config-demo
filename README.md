# Node.js Babel static demo

Demonstrates how to use Babel statically, to compile ES6 code to ES5 code.

* Install (everything you need is installed locally):

    ```
    cd node-babel-static-demo/
    npm install
    ```

* Build once:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

* Watch files, build whenever there are changes:

    ```
    npm run watch
    ```

* Run the app (as ES5 code, via the normal Node.js binary):

    ```
    npm start
    ```
